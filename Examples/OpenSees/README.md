# OpenSees Examples

This directory contains 5 examples that demonstrate improvements of the proposed transformations over the existing `CrdTransf` classes in OpenSees.

All tests can be run in a Posix shell by sourcing the script `test.sh`.

This example demonstrates the convergence characteristics of the new corotational transformations.
The standard problem of a curved 45-degree cantilever is implemented.
The following variants are investigated:

 <dt><tt>Test01-Geom01</tt></dt>
 <dd>This is the formulation that is currently available in OpenSees as the <tt>Corotational</tt> transformation.
     It can be executed with both the <tt>OpenSees</tt> executable, and the <tt>xara</tt> executable.
